## This Fork
- A new look for HlstatsX, inspired by the selfhosted gameserver software called Pterodactyl.
- A script that deploys HlstatsX:CE on a freshly installed Debian 12 system.

   Removed the following functions.
 - AJAX gliding server list (accordion effect) on homepage of each game. Server info will now be accessible when clicked on a particular server. (this was already there but is now permanent).
